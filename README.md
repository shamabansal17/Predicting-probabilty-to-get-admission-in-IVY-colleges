# **Educational Institution Prediction Model**
<br>
Model creation after exploratory data analysis of an educational institution to assist students in gaining admission to prestigious colleges.

## **About Company**
<br>
Jamboree is a renowned educational institution that has successfully assisted numerous students 
in gaining admission to top colleges abroad. Their proven
problem-solving methods have helped students achieve exceptional scores on
exams like the GMAT, GRE, and SAT with minimal effort.

## **Problem Statement**
<br>
Jamboree recently launched a feature where students/learners can come to their website and check their probability of
getting into the IVY league college. This feature estimates the chances of graduate admission from an Indian perspective.
This analysis will help Jamboree understand what factors are important in graduate admissions and how these factors 
are interrelated among themselves. It will also help predict one's chances of admission given the rest of the variables.

## **Benefits of case study**<br>

### From Jamboree’s perspective: <br>

● To further support students Jamboree recently introduced a new feature on their
website. This feature enables students to assess their probability of admission to Ivy
League colleges, considering the unique perspective of Indian applicants.<br>
● By conducting a thorough analysis, we can assist Jamboree in understanding the crucial
factors impacting graduate admissions and their interrelationships. Additionally, we can
provide predictive insights to determine an individual's admission chances based on
various variables.
<br>
### From the learner’s perspective:<br>
● Solving this business case holds immense importance for aspiring data scientists and
ML engineers.<br>
● Building predictive models using machine learning is widely popular among the data
scientists/ML engineers. By working through this case study, individuals gain hands-on
experience and practical skills in the field.<br>
● Additionally, it will enhance one's ability to communicate with the stakeholders
involved in data-related projects and help the organization take better, data-driven
decisions.
